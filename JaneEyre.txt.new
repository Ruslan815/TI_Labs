chapter i there was no possibility of taking a walk that day we had been wandering indeed in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning but since dinner mrs reed when there was no company dined early the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre and a rain so penetrating that further outdoor exercise was now out of the question i was glad of it i never liked long walks especially on chilly afternoons dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight with nipped fingers and toes and a heart saddened by the chidings of bessie the nurse and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to eliza john and georgiana reed the said eliza john and georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawingroom she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside and with her darlings about her for the time neither quarrelling nor crying looked perfectly happy me she had dispensed from joining the group saying she regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance but that until she heard from bessie and could discover by her own observation that i was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition a more attractive and sprightly mannersomething lighter franker more natural as it wereshe really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented happy little children what does bessie say i have done i asked jane i dont like cavillers or questioners besides there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner be seated somewhere and until you can speak pleasantly remain silent a breakfastroom adjoined the drawingroom i slipped in there it contained a bookcase i soon possessed myself of a volume taking care that it should be one stored with pictures i mounted into the windowseat gathering up my feet i sat crosslegged like a turk and having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close i was shrined in double retirement folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand to the left were the clear panes of glass protecting but not separating me from the drear november day at intervals while turning over the leaves of my book i studied the aspect of that winter afternoon afar it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud near a scene of wet lawn and stormbeat shrub with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast i returned to my bookbewicks history of british birds the letterpress thereof i cared little for generally speaking and yet there were certain introductory pages that child as i was i could not pass quite as a blank they were those which treat of the haunts of seafowl of the solitary rocks and promontories by them only inhabited of the coast of norway studded with isles from its southern extremity the lindeness or naze to the north cape where the northern ocean in vast whirls boils round the naked melancholy isles of farthest thule and the atlantic surge pours in among the stormy hebrides nor could i pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of lapland siberia spitzbergen nova zembla iceland greenland with the vast sweep of the arctic zone and those forlorn regions of dreary spacethat reservoir of frost and snow where firm fields of ice the accumulation of centuries of winters glazed in alpine heights above heights surround the pole and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold of these deathwhite realms i formed an idea of my own shadowy like all the halfcomprehended notions that float dim through childrens brains but strangely impressive the words in these introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast to the cold and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking i cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard with its inscribed headstone its gate its two trees its low horizon girdled by a broken wall and its newlyrisen crescent attesting the hour of eventide the two ships becalmed on a torpid sea i believed to be marine phantoms the fiend pinning down the thiefs pack behind him i passed over quickly it was an object of terror so was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock surveying a distant crowd surrounding a gallows each picture told a story mysterious often to my undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings yet ever profoundly interesting as interesting as the tales bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings when she chanced to be in good humour and when having brought her ironingtable to the nursery hearth she allowed us to sit about it and while she got up mrs reeds lace frills and crimped her nightcap borders fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads or as at a later period i discovered from the pages of pamela and henry earl of moreland with bewick on my knee i was then happy happy at least in my way i feared nothing but interruption and that came too soon the breakfastroom door opened boh madam mope cried the voice of john reed then he paused he found the room apparently empty where the dickens is she he continued lizzy georgy calling to his sisters joan is not here tell mama she is run out into the rainbad animal it is well i drew the curtain thought i and i wished fervently he might not discover my hidingplace nor would john reed have found it out himself he was not quick either of vision or conception but eliza just put her head in at the door and said at once she is in the windowseat to be sure jack and i came out immediately for i trembled at the idea of being dragged forth by the said jack what do you want i asked with awkward diffidence say what do you want master reed was the answer i want you to come here and seating himself in an armchair he intimated by a gesture that i was to approach and stand before him john reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old four years older than i for i was but ten large and stout for his age with a dingy and unwholesome skin thick lineaments in a spacious visage heavy limbs and large extremities he gorged himself habitually at table which made him bilious and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks he ought now to have been at school but his mama had taken him home for a month or two on account of his delicate health mr miles the master affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home but the mothers heart turned from an opinion so harsh and inclined rather to the more refined idea that johns sallowness was owing to overapplication and perhaps to pining after home john had not much affection for his mother and sisters and an antipathy to me he bullied and punished me not two or three times in the week nor once or twice in the day but continually every nerve i had feared him and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near there were moments when i was bewildered by the terror he inspired because i had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his inflictions the servants did not like to offend their young master by taking my part against him and mrs reed was blind and deaf on the subject she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me though he did both now and then in her very presence more frequently however behind her back habitually obedient to john i came up to his chair he spent some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without damaging the roots i knew he would soon strike and while dreading the blow i mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would presently deal it i wonder if he read that notion in my face for all at once without speaking he struck suddenly and strongly i tottered and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his chair that is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since said he and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains and for the look you had in your eyes two minutes since you rat accustomed to john reeds abuse i never had an idea of replying to it my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the insult what were you doing behind the curtain he asked i was reading show the book i returned to the window and fetched it thence you have no business to take our books you are a dependent mama says you have no money your father left you none you ought to beg and not to live here with gentlemens children like us and eat the same meals we do and wear clothes at our mamas expense now ill teach you to rummage my bookshelves for they are mine all the house belongs to me or will do in a few years go and stand by the door out of the way of the mirror and the windows i did so not at first aware what was his intention but when i saw him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it i instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm not soon enough however the volume was flung it hit me and i fell striking my head against the door and cutting it the cut bled the pain was sharp my terror had passed its climax other feelings succeeded wicked and cruel boy i said you are like a murdereryou are like a slavedriveryou are like the roman emperors i had read goldsmiths history of rome and had formed my opinion of nero caligula c also i had drawn parallels in silence which i never thought thus to have declared aloud what what he cried did she say that to me did you hear her eliza and georgiana wont i tell mama but first he ran headlong at me i felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder he had closed with a desperate thing i really saw in him a tyrant a murderer i felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering these sensations for the time predominated over fear and i received him in frantic sort i dont very well know what i did with my hands but he called me rat rat and bellowed out aloud aid was near him eliza and georgiana had run for mrs reed who was gone upstairs she now came upon the scene followed by bessie and her maid abbot we were parted i heard the words dear dear what a fury to fly at master john did ever anybody see such a picture of passion then mrs reed subjoined take her away to the redroom and lock her in there four hands were immediately laid upon me and i was borne upstairs chapter ii i resisted all the way a new thing for me and a circumstance which greatly strengthened the bad opinion bessie and miss abbot were disposed to entertain of me the fact is i was a trifle beside myself or rather out of myself as the french would say i was conscious that a moments mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties and like any other rebel slave i felt resolved in my desperation to go all lengths hold her arms miss abbot shes like a mad cat for shame for shame cried the ladysmaid what shocking conduct miss eyre to strike a young gentleman your benefactresss son your young master master how is he my master am i a servant no you are less than a servant for you do nothing for your keep there sit down and think over your wickedness they had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by mrs reed and had thrust me upon a stool my impulse was to rise from it like a spring their two pair of hands arrested me instantly if you dont sit still you must be tied down said bessie miss abbot lend me your garters she would break mine directly miss abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature this preparation for bonds and the additional ignominy it inferred took a little of the excitement out of me dont take them off i cried i will not stir in guarantee whereof i attached myself to my seat by my hands mind you dont said bessie and when she had ascertained that i was really subsiding she loosened her hold of me then she and miss abbot stood with folded arms looking darkly and doubtfully on my face as incredulous of my sanity she never did so before at last said bessie turning to the abigail but it was always in her was the reply ive told missis often my opinion about the child and missis agreed with me shes an underhand little thing i never saw a girl of her age with so much cover bessie answered not but ere long addressing me she saidyou ought to be aware miss that you are under obligations to mrs reed she keeps you if she were to turn you off you would have to go to the poorhouse i had nothing to say to these words they were not new to me my very first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind this reproach of my dependence had become a vague singsong in my ear very painful and crushing but only half intelligible miss abbot joined in and you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the misses reed and master reed because missis kindly allows you to be brought up with them they will have a great deal of money and you will have none it is your place to be humble and to try to make yourself agreeable to them what we tell you is for your good added bessie in no harsh voice you should try to be useful and pleasant then perhaps you would have a home here but if you become passionate and rude missis will send you away i am sure besides said miss abbot god will punish her he might strike her dead in the midst of her tantrums and then where would she go come bessie we will leave her i wouldnt have her heart for anything say your prayers miss eyre when you are by yourself for if you dont repent something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and fetch you away they went shutting the door and locking it behind them the redroom was a square chamber very seldom slept in i might say never indeed unless when a chance influx of visitors at gateshead hall rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it contained yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the mansion a bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany hung with curtains of deep red damask stood out like a tabernacle in the centre the two large windows with their blinds always drawn down were half shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery the carpet was red the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth the walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it the wardrobe the toilettable the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany out of these deep surrounding shades rose high and glared white the piledup mattresses and pillows of the bed spread with a snowy marseilles counterpane scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easychair near the head of the bed also white with a footstool before it and looking as i thought like a pale throne this room was chill because it seldom had a fire it was silent because remote from the nursery and kitchen solemn because it was known to be so seldom entered the housemaid alone came here on saturdays to wipe from the mirrors and the furniture a weeks quiet dust and mrs reed herself at far intervals visited it to review the contents of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe where were stored divers parchments her jewelcasket and a miniature of her deceased husband and in those last words lies the secret of the redroomthe spell which kept it so lonely in spite of its grandeur mr reed had been dead nine years it was in this chamber he breathed his last here he lay in state hence his coffin was borne by the undertakers men and since that day a sense of dreary consecration had guarded it from frequent intrusion my seat to which bessie and the bitter miss abbot had left me riveted was a low ottoman near the marble chimneypiece the bed rose before me to my right hand there was the high dark wardrobe with subdued broken reflections varying the gloss of its panels to my left were the muffled windows a great lookingglass between them repeated the vacant majesty of the bed and room i was not quite sure whether they had locked the door and when i dared move i got up and went to see alas yes no jail was ever more secure returning i had to cross before the lookingglass my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed all looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality and the strange little figure there gazing at me with a white face and arms specking the gloom and glittering eyes of fear moving where all else was still had the effect of a real spirit i thought it like one of the tiny phantoms half fairy half imp bessies evening stories represented as coming out of lone ferny dells in moors and appearing before the eyes of belated travellers i returned to my stool superstition was with me at that moment but it was not yet her hour for complete victory my blood was still warm the mood of the revolted slave was still bracing me with its bitter vigour i had to stem a rapid rush of retrospective thought before i quailed to the dismal present all john reeds violent tyrannies all his sisters proud indifference all his mothers aversion all the servants partiality turned up in my disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well why was i always suffering always browbeaten always accused for ever condemned why could i never please why was it useless to try to win any ones favour eliza who was headstrong and selfish was respected georgiana who had a spoiled temper a very acrid spite a captious and insolent carriage was universally indulged her beauty her pink cheeks and golden curls seemed to give delight to all who looked at her and to purchase indemnity for every fault john no one thwarted much less punished though he twisted the necks of the pigeons killed the little peachicks set the dogs at the sheep stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory he called his mother old girl too sometimes reviled her for her dark skin similar to his own bluntly disregarded her wishes not unfrequently tore and spoiled her silk attire and he was still her own darling i dared commit no fault i strove to fulfil every duty and i was termed naughty and tiresome sullen and sneaking from morning to noon and from noon to night my head still ached and bled with the blow and fall i had received no one had reproved john for wantonly striking me and because i had turned against him to avert farther irrational violence i was loaded with general opprobrium unjustunjust said my reason forced by the agonising stimulus into precocious though transitory power and resolve equally wrought up instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable oppressionas running away or if that could not be effected never eating or drinking more and letting myself die what a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon how all my brain was in tumult and all my heart in insurrection yet in what darkness what dense ignorance was the mental battle fought i could not answer the ceaseless inward questionwhy i thus suffered now at the distance ofi will not say how many years i see it clearly i was a discord in gateshead hall i was like nobody there i had nothing in harmony with mrs reed or her children or her chosen vassalage if they did not love me in fact as little did i love them they were not bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one amongst them a heterogeneous thing opposed to them in temperament in capacity in propensities a useless thing incapable of serving their interest or adding to their pleasure a noxious thing cherishing the germs of indignation at their treatment of contempt of their judgment i know that had i been a sanguine brilliant careless exacting handsome romping childthough equally dependent and friendlessmrs reed would have endured my presence more complacently her children would have entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellowfeeling the servants would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery daylight began to forsake the redroom it was past four oclock and the beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight i heard the rain still beating continuously on the staircase window and the wind howling in the grove behind the hall i grew by degrees cold as a stone and then my courage sank my habitual mood of humiliation selfdoubt forlorn depression fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire all said i was wicked and perhaps i might be so what thought had i been but just conceiving of starving myself to death that certainly was a crime and was i fit to die or was the vault under the chancel of gateshead church an inviting bourne in such vault i had been told did mr reed lie buried and led by this thought to recall his idea i dwelt on it with gathering dread i could not remember him but i knew that he was my own unclemy mothers brotherthat he had taken me when a parentless infant to his house and that in his last moments he had required a promise of mrs reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children mrs reed probably considered she had kept this promise and so she had i dare say as well as her nature would permit her but how could she really like an interloper not of her race and unconnected with her after her husbands death by any tie it must have been most irksome to find herself bound by a hardwrung pledge to stand in the stead of a parent to a strange child she could not love and to see an uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her own family group a singular notion dawned upon me i doubted notnever doubtedthat if mr reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly and now as i sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed wallsoccasionally also turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaning mirrori began to recall what i had heard of dead men troubled in their graves by the violation of their last wishes revisiting the earth to punish the perjured and avenge the oppressed and i thought mr reeds spirit harassed by the wrongs of his sisters child might quit its abodewhether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the departedand rise before me in this chamber i wiped my tears and hushed my sobs fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a preternatural voice to comfort me or elicit from the gloom some haloed face bending over me with strange pity this idea consolatory in theory i felt would be terrible if realised with all my might i endeavoured to stifle iti endeavoured to be firm shaking my hair from my eyes i lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room at this moment a light gleamed on the wall was it i asked myself a ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind no moonlight was still and this stirred while i gazed it glided up to the ceiling and quivered over my head i can now conjecture readily that this streak of light was in all likelihood a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn but then prepared as my mind was for horror shaken as my nerves were by agitation i thought the swift darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world my heart beat thick my head grew hot a sound filled my ears which i deemed the rushing of wings something seemed near me i was oppressed suffocated endurance broke down i rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort steps came running along the outer passage the key turned bessie and abbot entered miss eyre are you ill said bessie what a dreadful noise it went quite through me exclaimed abbot take me out let me go into the nursery was my cry what for are you hurt have you seen something again demanded bessie oh i saw a light and i thought a ghost would come i had now got hold of bessies hand and she did not snatch it from me she has screamed out on purpose declared abbot in some disgust and what a scream if she had been in great pain one would have excused it but she only wanted to bring us all here i know her naughty tricks what is all this demanded another voice peremptorily and mrs reed came along the corridor her cap flying wide her gown rustling stormily abbot and bessie i believe i gave orders that jane eyre should be left in the redroom till i came to her myself miss jane screamed so loud maam pleaded bessie let her go was the only answer loose bessies hand child you cannot succeed in getting out by these means be assured i abhor artifice particularly in children it is my duty to show you that tricks will not answer you will now stay here an hour longer and it is only on condition of perfect submission and stillness that i shall liberate you then o aunt have pity forgive me i cannot endure itlet me be punished some other way i shall be killed if silence this violence is all most repulsive and so no doubt she felt it i was a precocious actress in her eyes she sincerely looked on me as a compound of virulent passions mean spirit and dangerous duplicity bessie and abbot having retreated mrs reed impatient of my now frantic anguish and wild sobs abruptly thrust me back and locked me in without farther parley i heard her sweeping away and soon after she was gone i suppose i had a species of fit unconsciousness closed the scene
